# Additional items needed to be able to start the Sling Launchpad
# using the :crankstart feature found in this folder + this file + 
# the standard model from launchpad/builder so that it passes 
# the Sling integration tests. As of June 11th, 2015 this is
# not fully working, some integration tests fail. Probably due,
# at least in part, to run modes not being implemented yet, which
# means we possibly get conflicting bundles.
#
# Using this, currently 11 Sling tests from launchpad/integration-tests
# fail, out of 528, when starting Sling with the following commands:
# rm -rf CRANKSTART derby.log jackrabbit
# java -Dcrankstart.model.http.port=8080 \
# -Dsling.run.modes=:standalone,jackrabbit -jar \
# target/org.apache.sling.crankstart.launcher-1.9.9-SNAPSHOT.jar \ 
# src/test/resources/crankstart-model.txt \
# src/test/resources/launchpad-addons.txt \
# ../../..//launchpad/builder/src/main/provisioning
