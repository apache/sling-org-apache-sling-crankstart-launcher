# Additional items needed to be able to start the Sling Launchpad
# using the :crankstart feature found in this folder + this file + 
# the standard model from launchpad/builder so that it passes 
# the Sling integration tests. As of June 11th, 2015 this is
# not fully working, some integration tests fail. Probably due,
# at least in part, to run modes not being implemented yet, which
# means we possibly get conflicting bundles.
