# Apache Sling Crankstart Launcher

This module is part of the [Apache Sling](https://sling.apache.org) project.

This small and generic OSGi launcher starts a Sling instance (or anything else for that matter) by interpreting a Sling Provisioning Model at runtime.

The Sling Provisioning Model syntax is described at [The Apache Sling Provisioning Model and Apache SlingStart](https://sling.apache.org/documentation/development/slingstart.html).
